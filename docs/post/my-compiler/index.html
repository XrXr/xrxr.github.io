            <p>The first commit I made for my compiler was in 2016, it read &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping I get this done in time&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I met the deadline that message was referring to, but the compiler is certainly &ldquo;done&rdquo; now.</p>
<p>Of course, no one in the right mind would use the compiler for anything serious, but the <a href="https://www.github.com/XrXr/alang">compiler</a> compiles code,
and I&rsquo;ve made a simple graphical <a href="https://www.github.com/XrXr/souvenir">app launcher</a> using it.</p>
<p>I mostly want to talk about the human aspects of this project. I find a lot of technical stuff in the project interesting
too, but as somebody who is very much a novice at building compilers, I don&rsquo;t think I bring much to the
table talking about compiler construction.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-started">How it started</h3>
<p>I started the project in the summer of 2016. As a co-op student, I was supposed to intern at a company. Everyone seemed
to have found jobs for the summer, but I didn&rsquo;t. I felt really bitter that people who I considered less competent than me
were able to find jobs while I was left jobless. I felt the need to get better, I felt resentment.</p>
<p>Thinking back, the reason I didn&rsquo;t find a job was probably that I started
searching too late. Most companies have filled their internship quota by the time I started looking.
It turned out that resentment wasn&rsquo;t a very effective fuel for me. I would put in an hour of work every day, even though
I basically had nothing else to do. I wanted to build the compiler from scratch as much as possible, and
there were a lot of problems I had to focus and think about for extended periods of time. Watching YouTube videos
and playing games is much easier to do than thinking hard.</p>
<p>As much as I wanted to force myself to work on a project so I can impress potential employers, not much work was done
on the compiler during the summer of 2016.</p>
<h3 id="reboot-and-critical-mass">Reboot and critical mass</h3>
<p>I stopped working on the compiler when the summer ended and didn&rsquo;t work on it at all for most of 2017. In December of
2017, I got the idea to work on the compiler again. I wanted to prove to myself that I can build a compiler, I also
wanted a sort of souvenir for my time at the university. Jonathan Blow&rsquo;s compiler development livestreams were also a source of inspiration.</p>
<p>I got loops and procedures working in December. These two features, along with the support for conditionals I implemented in 2016, made the compiler feel tangible and actually sort of usable. Working on the compiler didn&rsquo;t feel like a drag anymore, every commit felt like real progress.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-got-finished">How it got finished</h3>
<p>I graduated from school in April of 2018. I had the privilege to take a 4-month break before starting work, so I used a lot
of that time on the compiler. The compiler presented more and more interesting problems as it matured. Even though I reached my original goal of making <a href="https://www.github.com/XrXr/souvenir">an app launcher</a> using my language, I kept working on the compiler because it proved to be an interesting sandbox for me to try out different ideas. The world was my oyster and I had the freedom and time to implement whatever I wanted. I had fun working on the compiler.</p>
<h3 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h3>
<p>I am proud of my compiler. The code is nothing I would consider exemplary. Many would probably call it &ldquo;unmaintainable&rdquo;, and they would be right.
However, I&rsquo;m still proud of the project. I learned a lot working on this project and part of what I learned was why some of the decisions
I made in the compiler were terrible. If I were to work on this compiler again, the first thing I would do is rewrite many
parts of it.</p>
<p>I feel that I have overcome many obstacles and came out of the other side with two pieces of real, usable software.
<a href="https://www.github.com/XrXr/souvenir">souvenir</a>, the application launcher I made using the compiler, is installed on my machine at home and I use it every day.</p>
<p>I think I will always look back at the time I worked on the compiler fondly. Not many people get to write software
just for the sake of it and I doubt I will get to do something like this again anytime soon. I am thankful for everything
that contributed to this unique experience.</p>
