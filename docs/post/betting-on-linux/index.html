            <p>Recently, I took a distribution version update for a Ubuntu system with a GTX
460 and I ended up spending a few hours to find out that the proprietary driver
no longer works with the newest kernels. The open source <code>nouveau</code> driver
didn&rsquo;t handle the decade old card any better. I had to downgrade to an older
LTS kernel and use Nvidia&rsquo;s driver.</p>
<p>A different machine of mine running Raven Ridge integrated graphics recently
also started to have issues. It freezes and dumps scary red text about <code>amdgpu</code>
to the kernel ring buffer. This reminds me of when I first bought the machine
in 2018, when Raven Ridge was new and the drivers for it nascent. It eventually
stabilized, but now the crashes are back.</p>
<p>Despite all the woes, I&rsquo;m getting the Pine64 Note, an eReader running mainline
Linux. I&rsquo;ll probably have problems with it. The userland is new, and maybe the
graphics drivers will flake out on me, but I&rsquo;m going with it anyways.</p>
<p>This is an aspirational purchase. I want to read more. Glance away from the
ultraprocessed flashing lights designed to monetize my attention. Also,
diagnosing these issues doesn&rsquo;t seem like the worst hobby. To borrow from the
chapter about sunsets in <em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em>, &ldquo;I want to be earnest,
even if it&rsquo;s embarrassing.&rdquo; I want to get out of my armor of cynicism and be
vulnerable.</p>
