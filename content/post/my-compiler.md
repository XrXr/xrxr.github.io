The first commit I made for my compiler was in 2016, it read "Here's hoping I get this done in time".
I'm not sure if met the deadline the message was refering to, but the compiler is certainly "done" now.

Of course no one in the right mind would use the compiler for anything serious, but the [compiler] compiles code,
and I've made a simple graphical [app launcher][souvenir] using it.

I mostly want to talk about the human aspects to this project. I find a lot of technical stuff in the project interesting
too, but as somebody who is very much a novice at building compilers, I don't think I bring much to the
table talking about compiler construction.

### How it started

I started the project in the summer of 2016. As a co-op student, I was supposed to intern at a company. Everyone seemed
to have found jobs for the summer, but I didn't. I felt really bitter that people who I considered less compotent than me
was able to find jobs while I was left jobless. I felt the need to get better, I felt resentment.

Thinking back, the reason I didn't find a job was probably because I started
searching too late; most companies have filled their internship quota by the time I started looking.
It turned out that resentment wasn't a very effective fuel. I would put in an hour of work every day, even though
I basically had nothing else to do. I wanted to build the compiler from the scratch as much as possible, and
there were a lot of problems I had to focus and think about for an extended period of time. Watching Youtube videos
and whatever is much easier to do than thinking about hard problems.

As much as I wanted to force myself to work on project so I can impress potential employers, not much work was done
on the compiler during the summer of 2016.

### Reboot and critical mass

I stopped working on the compiler when the summer ended and didn't work on it at all for most of 2017. In December of
2017, I got the idea to work on the compiler again. I wanted to prove to myself that I can build a compiler, I also
wanted a sort of souvenir for my time at the university. I was also inspired by Jonathan Blow and his compiler development
livestreams.

I got loops and procedures working in December. These two features, along with the ifs I implemented in 2016, made the
compiler feel tangible and actually sort of usable. Working on the compiler didn't feel like a drag anymore, because there
was reassurance that as long as I kept going, I can get closer to the finish line.

### How it got done

I graduated from school April of 2018. I had the privilege to take a 4-month break before starting work, so I used a lot
of that time on the compiler. The project got more and more interesting as I worked on it since I discovered many directions
I could explore. I could've called the project "done" halfway through my post-grad break. I had the app launcher working,
but I kept working on code generation. Any direction I wanted to take the compiler felt tangible
and reachable. I had fun working on the compiler.

### Was it worth it?

I am proud of my compiler. The code is nothing I would consider exemplary and many would probably call it "unmaintainable",
but I'm still proud the project. I learned a lot working on this project and part of what I learend was why some of the decisions
I made in the compiler are terrible. If I were to work on this compiler again, the first thing I would do is rewrite many
parts of it.

I feel that I have overcame many obstacles and came out of the other side with two pieces of real, usable software.
[souvenir], the application launcher I made using the compiler, is installed on my machine at home and I use it every day.

I think I will always look back at the time I worked on the compiler fondly. Not many people get to write software
just for the sake of it and I doubt I will get to do something similar anytime soon. I am thankful for all the things
that contributed to this unique experience.
