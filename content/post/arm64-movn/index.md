The bit twiddling office called. They want a function to compute a sequence of
ARM64 instructions that fills a register with an arbitrary constant 64-bit
number.

## Zeros in positive number

All ARM64 instructions are 32 bits long, so one instruction can't possibly
handle all 64-bit patterns. One straightforward way to assemble the desired bit
pattern is to use
[`MOVK`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/MOVK--Move-wide-with-keep-?lang=en)
which sets any one of the four 16-bit chunks of the register without touching
any other chunks. So, four `MOVK` instructions can assemble any 64-bit pattern.

Adding [`MOVZ`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/MOVZ--Move-wide-with-zero-?lang=en) to the mix improves this strategy. Small numbers have many zeros
in the pattern, so we'd rather start by zeroing the whole register than
zeroing out one 16-bit chunk at a time with `MOVK`. In one go, `MOVZ` sets one
16-bit chunk to the desired value and also zeros out all other chunks. For
small numbers like 7, all we need is one `MOVZ`.

## The negative ones

Another instruction in the same family is
[`MOVN`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/MOVN--Move-wide-with-NOT-?lang=en).
It sets the register like `MOVZ`, but with all bits inverted. So, `MOVN` sets
the three chunks that are not directly encoded in the instruction to all ones.
Why would you want so many ones? Negative numbers!

The most significant bit of a two's complement number contributes negatively to
the value tally unlike the rest of the bits. Adding a leading one to the bit
string makes the old most significant bit at position K go from having a value
of {{<html>}}-2<sup>K</sup> to 2<sup>K</sup>, adding
2â€¢2<sup>K</sup>=2<sup>K+1</sup> to the balance. The new leading one at K+1 has
value -2<sup>K+1</sup>{{</html>}}, though, so adding a leading one preserves
the numeric value of the encoded number. This is one way to see why -1 is
encoded as all bits ones. Start with a single one and add leading ones.

Leading ones are to negative numbers what leading zeros are to positive
numbers. [^1]

[^1]: It follows that [`n.leading_zeros() + n.leading_ones() + 1`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html#method.leading_zeros) gives the
shortest number of bits a number takes to encode. One of the terms in the sum
is always zero.

## Strategy using `MOVN`

Using `MOVN` and `MOVK` gives a pretty good strategy for negative numbers.
Sometimes, the whole sequence takes fewer than 64 bits. That's shorter
than `movabs` from x86-64, which uses a 64-bit immediate.

For the constant `N`, pick a 16-bit chunk in that is not all bits set and use a
`MOVN` to set the chunk, filling all other chunks with ones as well. If no such
chunk exists, then all bits are set, and we're done with a single `MOVN`.
Otherwise, set other chunks of `N` with `MOVK`.

If there is even a single 16-bit chunk of ones in `N`, the initial `MOVN`
finishes setting two chunks or more in one go, beating out only using `MOVK`.
`MOVZ` covers positive numbers and `MOVN` covers the negatives.

This strategy is not limited to negative numbers. For example, it
sets `0x7000_ffff_cafe_ffff` with just two instructions.

## Play with it!

On a browser with WASM support, there should be an interactive toy below that
implements the `MOVN` strategy. It only uses `MOVN` and `MOVK`, so
don't expect the shortest possible sequence for all inputs. (For one, it won't attempt to use
a [bitmask
immediate](https://dougallj.wordpress.com/2021/10/30/bit-twiddling-optimising-aarch64-logical-immediate-encoding-and-decoding/).)
It's made with [`capstone-rs`](https://github.com/capstone-rust/capstone-rs)
compiled through
[`wasm32-unknown-emscripten`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-unknown-emscripten.html).
Please excuse the huge 3MB download size -- I made no effort minimizing it.
